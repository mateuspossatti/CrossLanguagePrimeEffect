Cross Language Associative Priming Effect Study

Summary:
This python project has the objective to improve the current knowledge about the cognitive basis of the bilingualism, specifically the Portuguese-English bilingualism. 
This study uses a combination of semantic decision task and associative priming technique to explore the correlation between the two language systems on the brain.
Through statistical analysis of the volunteers' reactions time in different test conditions, it's possible to draw conclusions about the brain organization of those language systems.
Besides the reaction time analysis, the associative use of electroencephalogram data can improve the final statistical analysis. 
Unfortunately, the high price of that equipment is a barrier to improve the quality of this study.

Instructions to execute the experiment:
1. Open the command line on the project directory and type the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt".
2. After the installation of the python packages, type "python peep.py".
3. Configure the monitor settings. You only need to answers the questions show. 
4. After the monitor configuration, type the number of the volunteer, type "y" to answer the start experiment question, and, finally, type "y" to save the data from the experiment. 
5. Follow the instructions show in the experiment's execution.
