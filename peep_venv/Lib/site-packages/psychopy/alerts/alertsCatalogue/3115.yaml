    Your stimuli {type}-time of {time} seconds cannot be accurately presented for {time} on a {Hz}Hz monitor.

# The following are typically used for online help pages, and support reStructured Text.

synopsis: |
  If using a 60Hz or 100Hz monitor, then for accurate presentation of visual stimuli,
  components must be presented in valid multiples of screen refresh for 60 Hz or 100 Hz.

details: |
  When presenting stimuli at, say, 60 Hz you stimulus can be presented for 1 frame (1/60 s = 16.667 ms),
  2 frames (2/60 s = 33.333 ms) but not for intervening periods (20 ms is not possible becuase the stimulus
  would have to be presented for a little more than 1 frame, which isn't phsyically possible on standard
  fixed-framerate monitors.

solutions: |
  For brief stimuli it's typically better to specify your stimulus in terms of the number of frames.
  For longer duration stimuli then make sure that your duration divides exactly into an integer
  number of frames if timing is important to you.
